# PDSBuddy
A companion container for self-hosted ATProto PDS instances

The first version of PDSBuddy will do one thing: PDS backup. It will generate a .car file from your PDS and store it in a GitHub repo. That's it.

Initially backups will only contain posts, likes, and follows. They will NOT include pictures/video or any other blob data.
